Last month, I had the incredible opportunity to shoot an editorial in the Mojave Desert. Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how we created these cinematic images.

## The Concept

The vision was to create a story about solitude and strength in vast, open spaces. The desert provided the perfect backdrop—minimal, dramatic, and timeless.

## The Team

- **Model**: Sarah Chen
- **Stylist**: Maya Rodriguez
- **Makeup Artist**: Alex Kim
- **Location**: Mojave Desert, California

## Challenges

### The Heat

Shooting in the desert in late summer meant temperatures over 100°F. We started at 5 AM to catch the best light and cooler temperatures.

### The Wind

Desert wind is unpredictable. What could have been a challenge became an asset—creating movement in fabric and adding drama to the shots.

### Logistics

Working in a remote location meant careful planning:
- Brought all water and supplies
- Scouted location in advance
- Had backup gear for everything

## Favorite Moments

The magic happened during golden hour when the sand dunes lit up with warm, golden light. The interplay between shadow and light created the dramatic, cinematic feel we were after.

## Technical Details

- **Camera**: Canon EOS R5
- **Lenses**: 35mm f/1.4, 85mm f/1.8, 70-200mm f/2.8
- **Lighting**: 100% natural light
- **Time**: 5 AM - 10 AM

## The Result

We came away with over 500 shots and a final selection of 25 images that perfectly captured our vision. The editorial will be featured in an upcoming publication—stay tuned for more details!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Prepare for the environment**: Bring extra water, sun protection, and have a backup plan
2. **Trust your team**: Working with talented creatives elevates the final result
3. **Embrace challenges**: The wind and heat that seemed like obstacles became part of the story
